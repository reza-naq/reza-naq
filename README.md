- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @reza-naq, with 25+ years of dev all over Europe (Fortran/Pascal/C/C++/Java/Ruby/Rails)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web dev & Concurrency.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Functional Programming with Elixit & Phoenix (PETAL stack). Here I find a new paradigm. It's a sort of being reborn in DEV dimension. I think I've NEVER been so excited in learning and doing things. Now evenwhen I go back to my legacy Rails apps, I see them differently and I think I do better job in my Ruby stack.
- Changing the paradigm, which means becoming AGAIN a newbe, is an exciting challenge. It goes far beyond learning a new syntaxe. Learning OO was a huge step forward because it brought a new and highly efficient paradigm, comparing to procedural programming with C & before.
- Functional programming takes he challenge to a higher level.
- The special thing with ELixir is that beyond being a FP language, it brings the beauty of Ruby (which I loved & keep loving) and the unique industrial power of Erlang. I feel, for the first time, that what I write has a flaviour of 'programming poetry' build upon a solid foundation.
- Standing gratefully on the shoulders of the previous giants is the secret of going further.
- So far I've seen lots of love and enthusiasm in the community. Hope it continues.
